# OctraLabs Developer Documentation

## Overview
Welcome to the developer documentation for **OctraLabs**, an organization focused on building cryptographic utilities and methods for implementing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** applications. Our tools and libraries enable developers to perform various mathematical operations securely within the **Octra** FHE blockchain network, which supports isolated execution environments.

This repository contains guides, libraries, and technical documentation for developing applications on the Octra platform. Most of our codebase is written in **OCaml**, **Rust**, and **C++**, and will be open-source, allowing you to use it freely for your projects.

> **Note**: The documentation is still under development and not yet publicly available. Content published here is subject to change and may not represent the final version. Stay tuned for updates!

## Key Features
- **FHE Implementation**: Tools for performing mathematical operations using Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
- **Hypergraph FHE Library**: A standalone library for FHE with bootstrapping on hypergraphs, compatible with external projects.
- **IrminDB Integration**: Extended functionality for IrminDB, optimized for validators and vector object processing in the Octra blockchain.
- **Isolated Execution Environments**: Secure environments for running applications on the Octra network.

## Getting Started
The majority of the code and detailed documentation will be released after the public launch of the **Octra testnet**. Once available, you will find:
- Comprehensive guides for developing on the Octra platform.
- Libraries that can be ported to other projects.
- Examples and tutorials for integrating FHE into your applications.
